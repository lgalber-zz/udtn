inga_tool is a utility to reset the INGA and update the FTDI EEPROM

To build it you need at least libftdi version 0.19, libusb, libudev and libpopt.
Just typing
 $ make
should build the binary. I might add autotools support eventually.


Use it like this to reset an INGA node:
./inga_tool -d <usbserial> -r

The following will flash the EEPROM (WARNING, not extensively tested):
./inga_tool -d <usbserial> -f -v

It is also possible to choose a device based on the USB serial:
./inga_tool -s <serial>

Reset:
This is used to go into the bootloader without the need to reset the device
manually. You'll need an up-to-date bootloader for this to work. In addition,
flashing the EEPROM of INGA is required before using the reset functionality.

Flashing:
Right now no options are supported for flashing, that will be something for the
future. The following changes will be made:
* manufacturer -> "IBR"
* product -> "INGA"
* cbus functions are set to
  CBUS0 TXLED
  CBUS1 RXLED
  CBUS2 TXDEN
  CBUS3 IOMODE
  CBUS4 SLEEP

Unchanged are VID/PID and the serial.
